### HIGH-LEVEL PROJECT SUMMARY

We developed an ML-based and ANN model predict or estimate the characteristic values of solar wind. This model emulate the behavior of DISCOVR station to help it to still producing data for prevent a high solar torment event. This is very important because if the Carrington event could be occur again the damage over our planet could be very serious and danger.

### DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION

In this work, we present a ML-based and ANN able to predict protons' velocity, density and Temperature, which is needed to estimate the main parameters of solar winds. It's input data are composed by the sensors' measurements of the DSCOVR spacecraft. In other words, we are comparing these two models, regression model and a Neural Network to achieve a parameters classification.

The most challenging part of this project was Data analysis. We have used two main tools: Python programming language, and Matlab (only to understand raw data). Our entire framework was written in Python (notebook and scripts) with the following hardware specs: Intel® Core™ i5-7 CPU @ 2.60GHz × 4 and 12GB of RAM.

After some tests, we have noticed that this method could play a crucial role in preventing Carrington-like events in future .
